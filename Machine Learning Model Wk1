# Machine Learning Model

Our model will be a logistic regression to predict the relationship between the likelihood of a crash resulting in a fatality for every dollar that the price of gasoline went up in the years 2019 to 2021, along with other significant variables.

##Dependent variable:

- probability that a traffic incident resulted in a fatality


##independent variables:

- U.S. Average price of gasoline (dollars per gallon)
- Failure to require restraint use by self or passengers (0 or 1)
- Whether or not there was impaired driving due to the use of alcohol, drugs, or prescription medication (0 or 1)
- Whether or not there was involvement of a vehicle travelling at an illegal high speed (0 or 1)
- Weather (levels)
- Day of the Week (levels)
- Light level (levels)
