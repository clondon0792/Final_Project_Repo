## Selected Topic: 
The Rise of Traffic Fatalities During the Pandemic and its Relation to the Price of Gas

## Reason for selecting topic: 
According to multiple reports from U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there was a rise in traffic fatalities during the pandemic. While the NHTSA attributes this rise as positively correlated to the rise of DUI/DWI’s, lack of seatbelt usage, and speeding, our team is curious to find out how the price of gasoline, which notably fell to $1.841 a gallon during May 2020 of the pandemic, may also be correlated. We also hope to see if the subsequent historic rise of gasoline prices shows a negative relationship with traffic fatalities.

## Description for source of data: 

We are sourcing our data related to the traffic fatalities directly National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (CSV). We are sourcing our data related to the average U.S. price of gasoline from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (XLS).


## Desired questions to answer with the data: 

- Can we verify that the variables offered by the NHTSA (speeding, seatbelt usage, DUI/DWIs) significantly explain the relationship between the rise of traffic fatalities?
- Does our added variable (average U.S. Price of Gasoline in dollars per gallon) contribute significantly to explain the rise of traffic fatalities?
- What other variables can we add to tell us why traffic fatalities rose during the pandemic?
